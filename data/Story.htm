<TITLE> A StoryHarp Generated Java Applet </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This is an example HTML file to call a StoryHarp player Java applet.
<p>
This applet will display the "Story.class" Java applet
after the source for "Story.java" is generated from StoryHarp 
and then compiled using a Java compiler to produce a file named "Story.class". If you do now have a "Story.class" file you will only see a gray box below.
<p>
For example, with a properly configured JDK100 or later from Sun, 
from the command prompt you would use "javac Story.java" to produce "Story.class". 
An IDE Java development system like Symantec Cafe 
may require making a simple project first.
<p> 
Since the applets generated compile under JDK 1.0,
they should run on a wide variety of browsers. 
If you are an experienced Java developer, 
and you are only supporting JDK 1.1 or later and the latest VMs,
you may wish to change the TextArea to do its own word wrapping by 
setting it to not have a horizontal scroll bar 
(using the constructor option)
after which you can remove the word wrapping code 
and use a non-proportional font.
<p>
If you wish to rename the file "Story.class" 
you will also have to rename the Java source file "Story.java", 
change the class name from "Story" to the name of the file in the Java source,
recompile the source, 
and finally change the file name referenced by this HTML page.
