As you probably know, Solarius 1746 is a forty kilometer long cylinder five kilometers in diameter, based loosely on the original O'Neill design.

While you have been thoroughly briefed on the customs of our world during your transit, I would like to remind you that projectile weapons are strictly prohibited within the main habitat.

We are proud that our space habitat is fully capable of duplicating itself from sunlight and asteroidal ore. Still, we have a strict recycling program in place to allow us to put as much new material into daughter habitats rather than replenishing supplies on this mostly self contained world. This system works optimally when you obey our local recycling laws for separating glass, aluminum, iron, and organic materials, and for properly disposing of other matter incorporating things like heavy metals. Otherwise we may have to re-smelt an entire batch of recyclables, and that always annoys the technical staff.
