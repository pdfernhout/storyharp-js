house
look
You are in a sturdy brick house, a flavorful house, a cheery house. You live here. It's a warm bright day, you're wearing your favorite purple bathrobe, you've just had a big breakfast, and you've just finished reading the paper.

water the plants
Let's see. Three plants are still hanging on to life. {picture test1} One has been half-eaten by Harold, and another one dried up. But the two plants you repotted a few months ago look fine. Those spider plants never stop making babies. You fill the water pitcher three times and water the plants, then sit down in the chair. You love the percolating sound and the satisfied smell.

The plants are still pretty wet right now. {picture test2} You check that they all got enough water, then sit down and enjoy their happiness for a while.

tidy up
You meander around the living room {picture test3} picking up stray junk mail and advertisements that fell out of magazines. You put away some of Harold's toys. You pick up the glass and bowl you left on the coffee table last night, and put them on the kitchen counter. You straighten the rug that never stays straight.

work on the puzzle
You've almost got that man wearing green put together, {picture test6} but his green is almost like the green on the shutters so it's been difficult. And yesterday Harold ate a red piece so the whole thing seems kind of fruitless now. But it's still fun when a piece fits right in. You find a few matches while you hover over the table.

Aha! There's the red piece you thought Harold ate! The stinker, he just hid it over by the windowsill. You put it on the pile of red and off-red pieces on the table. But the puzzle seems a little boring right now so you don't work on it any more.

look
It's spring, and it's Mudville out here. What a mess! But the air is so fresh it feels like you should be able to fly. The grass is struggling to make a comeback, and some foolish lilies are bursting out of the ground. Be careful, my friends! Give it another week.

walk in circles
Pacing is terribly underrated. Walking in a prescribed circle always feels good. That's why you put the patio stones just where you did. Three paces, turn, two paces, turn, four paces, turn.

pat the bunny
You can't pat the bunny, it's wild. It comes by all the time and sometimes it eats stuff you put on the compost pile. It eats plants in your garden, too, but you don't care. Just watching the plants come up is all you want from the garden. It's like a fish tank outside, only the plants last longer than fish.

It's a wild rabbit. I just said "pat the bunny" as a joke! There's a children's book by that name, okay? Leave the poor rabbit alone. Geez.

look at the sky
When you were in school, riding that stupid bus home, you used to sit way down in the seat so all you could see was the sky. When you look at the sky it's always summer, and anything you want to happen can happen under the sky. You can just substitute your own reality under the sky. Today the sky is bright but not sunny, a nice kind of let's-not-bother-each-other sky.

The sky is still the same. Except for the pterodactyl circling, nothing much is happening. You're glad Harold is getting some exercise in the good weather. Maybe he'll stop chewing on the bedpost.

All right, you asked for it! You find the least-wet spot and lie down. It's not that bad. You feel the warm air and the diffuse sun on your face. You feel a slight breeze. You feel the wet mud coming through your bathrobe! Ugh!

look at the herb garden
You look over the remains of the herb garden and the supposedly all-weather bird bath. A pile of chives has reappeared, surprisingly. You never take perennials all that seriously. You remember watching your box of Christmas herb vinegars come around the luggage belt at the airport, sideways. But everyone loved the vinegars, what was left of them. Next year it'll be dried herbs, you think.

poke around in the herb garden
The ground is still pretty cold. Fantastic planting schemes appear in your mind, juxtaposed with the fiasco last year's fantastic planting scheme created. Maybe you should stick to simple plants this year, and no geometric pattern.

turn over the herb garden
You think about turning over the herb garden, maybe just a little of it, right now. Why not? It's a beautiful day, Harold is busy, and you've got the time. You go and get your trowel. What's this? Oh, Harold's been out here hiding his toys again. Here's one of his diamond rings. Where does he get these things?

look at the diamond ring
You clean off the diamond ring with your bathrobe. Yeah, it's another one of the jewel-heist rings. It would be a lot easier if he could keep his toys in the toy box. You put it in your pocket to put it away later.
